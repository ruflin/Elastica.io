Elastica.io is the documentation for Elastica. [Elastica](http://github.com/ruflin/Elastica) is a PHP client for the [elasticsearch](http://elasticsearch.org) search engine/database. Elasticsearch is an Open Source (Apache 2), Distributed, RESTful, Search Engine built on top of Apache Lucene. Elastica itself is also open source and you can download or clone the source code on Github from [ruflin/Elastica](http://github.com/ruflin/Elastica).

These pages should give you an overview of how to use Elastica. You can find the complete [API here](api/index.html). Any contributions to the documentations are highly welcome. Elastica.io is based on [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) and is hosted on Github. Fork your copy from [ruflin/Elastica.io](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica.io) and open a full request.
