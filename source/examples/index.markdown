As everyone likes examples, here is list of examples. The perfect place to get even more examples is the quite extensive [test suite of Elastica](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/tree/master/test/lib/Elastica/Test). Select the object you want to know more about and check the test file for it. There you will probably have an example.

* General examples
  * [Raw array query](/example/raw-array-query.html)
  * [Raw JSON query](/example/raw-json-query.html)

* Query examples
  * [Bool query](/example/query/bool.html)
* Filter examples
* Sorting examples
  * [By Distance](/example/sort/sort.html#distance)
