As everyone likes examples, here is list of examples. The perfect place to get even more examples is the quite extensive [test suite of Elastica](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/tree/master/test/Elastica). Select the object you want to know more about and check the test file for it. There you will probably have an example.
